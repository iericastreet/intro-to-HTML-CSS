        <h1>the perfect trip to the beach </h1>

        <img src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/landscapes/beach-in-hawaii.png">
        
        <p>And animals like birds and tropical creatures, i think that would be interesting tosee cause you dont see that to often here </p>
        
        <p>And eat food that is different from here comparing to other places around the world</p>
